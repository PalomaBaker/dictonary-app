# Dictionary App

## Overview
A simple dictionary client that looks up words for the user from different websites, displays definitions, and allows the user to save the words for future reference.

## Planned Features
- compare different definitions and select the preferred definition
- save a list of words to a locally-stored file
- send words and their saved definitions to Anki through Anki card-making API

## Maybe, we'll see
- suggestions for words that return no matches (possibly due to spelling errors)
- wikitionary tie in showing additional info
- Oxford English Dictionary tie in? Unlikely to have time.
